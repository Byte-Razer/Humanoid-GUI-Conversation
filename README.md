## 🧠 Overview

The **Humanoid Project** is a school-based research and development initiative focused on building an intelligent, interactive humanoid system.  
This interface — codenamed **AURA** — serves as the **main control center** for managing recognition systems, training data, and user interactions through a visually dynamic and responsive UI.

Built with **PyQt5/PySide6**, AURA integrates animation, asynchronous processing, and modern design to create a professional, futuristic experience suitable for demonstration and expansion.
